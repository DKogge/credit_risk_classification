## Overview of the Analysis

* The purpose of the analysis was to predict healthy or high risk loans based on input data of different variables.
* Some of the variables included the size of the loan, the interest rate of the loan, the amount of the borrowers annual income, 
the amount of the borrowers total debt, the debt to income ratio, and also the number of accounts and how many derogatory accounts there were.
* Utilized a logistical regression model to fit the data and predict results based on the variables provided.

## Results

* Machine Learning Model:
    * Description of Model Accuracy - 99%
    * Precision - on healthy loans - 100%, on high risk loans - 85%
    * Recall score - on healthy loans - 99%, on high risk loans - 95%

## Summary
This was a great model to extrapolate data to find healthy loans, the precision on the high risk loans was not as strong and predicting those would be of high
importance to the bank as those would be likely in incur losses.  Recommendation would be to explore other models as well to determine if there is a better
solution for precision on the high risk loan predictions.
